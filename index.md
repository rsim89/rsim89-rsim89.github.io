# Who am I?

{: .lead .mb-3 }
I am a Ph.D. student in the Linguistics Program at <a href="https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/linguistics">USC</a>.​ 

{: .lead .mb-3 }
My research interest lies in the interface of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. ​Currently, I am working on Polarity Sensitive Items, Complement Patterns, Pseudo Passive Constructions, using corpus and experimental methods.
